DynamoDB :

=> important : each table needs a partition key (= primary key)
	- simple
	- composed (partition key + sort key)

Data is accessed only by the primary key

=> secondary indexes : recreate a new table


Data modeling process 
1 - ERD : entity relation diagrams 
- one-to-one 
- one-to-many 
- many-to-many

2 - List your access pattern
You must know ahead of time how dats are needed
- Projections : fields impacted
- Frequency : if high make a partition key

3 - GetItem API
- can return one or multiple key
