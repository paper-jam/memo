HA : High avaibility
ZA : 
CA : certificates authorities
Cipher suit : combinaison de chiffrement
ALB : 
NLB : Load balancer

Amazon aurora : 
- End writer -> DNS 
- end reader -> 


SSL : 
- Secure Socket layer : encrypt connection
- TLS ransport Layer Security : newer vesion
- TLS certificates are mailny used but people still refer as SSL

Handshake processus (detail K not required )
- Public SSL certificates are issued by CA (Certificate Authorities) (Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Let )
- SSL certificates have expiration dates
- Asymetric Encryption (SSL) is CPU expensive
- a two way SSL is possible : the client have also a certificat
- => secure communication with symetric key


SNI : server name indication 
- resolve problem of multiple SSL certicates on one web server
- client must indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial handshake
- works for ALB & NLB, Cloudfront
- Does not work for CLB (old generation)

how to prevent MIMMA (Man in the Middle Attack)
- use HTTPS (SSL/TLS), not HTTP
- domain name configured with DNSSEC
- Route 53 support DNSSEC, using KMS

----------------------------  AWS service --------------------------------
compute : EC2 , LAMBDA, Elastic Container Service, Elastic Load Balancer, Lightsail, Elastic Beanstalk
		most common : 
			- EC2 : Elastic Cloud Compute : webserice that allows developpers to rent virtual machines and helps to resize the compute capacity
			- LAMBDA : serverless compute service, excute code for a specific application _ don't need to create a server
			-  
storage :
			- S3 : Simple Storage Service : open cloud-based storage service for online data backup (data is put in buckets)
			- EBS : Elastic Bloc  Storage : 
				- high availability storage volume  for persistent data (mainly use with EC2 instances)


database :
			- RDS : Relational Database Service (mysql Postgresql Oracle Maria)
			- Dynamo DB : NoSql database
			- elastic search :  

Networking : connecting the pysical etwork to the private Virtual Network
			- VPC, Route53, Direct Connect, CloudFront,	
			- VPC : virtual private cloud : to deploy AWS resources (like EC2) into a private Virtual Cloud
			- Route 53 : DNS mapping service, translate text to IP adress
			-
