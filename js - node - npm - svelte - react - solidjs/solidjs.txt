-- ====== SOLIDJS ================



-- ===== introduction 

-- Entry point is the render function. It takes 2 arguments, a function wrapping our application code and an existing element in the HTML to mount to:
render ( function, html element)
render(() => <App />, document.getElementById('root'));

--  difference between JSX and html 
- JSX does not have void elements. This means that all elements must have a closing tag or self-close.
- JSX must return a single Element. if needed use <> </> for multiple top elements
- JSX doesn't support HTML Comments <!--...--> or special tags like <!DOCTYPE>.

-- Signals, effects, derived signals, memos
- const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  - const ["getter", "setter"] = createSignal("initial value");
  -  createEffect(() => { commande, signaleObserv√© }

- derived signals  : gain their reactivity from the signal they access
- Memos            : We can use memos to evaluate a function and store the result until its dependencies change.
